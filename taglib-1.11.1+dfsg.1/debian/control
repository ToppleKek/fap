Description: audio meta-data library
 TagLib is a library for reading and editing audio meta data, commonly know as
 tags.
 .
  - A clean, high level, C++ API to handling audio meta data.
  - Format specific APIs for advanced API users.
  - ID3v1, ID3v2, APE, FLAC, Xiph, iTunes-style MP4 and WMA tag formats.
  - MP3, MPC, FLAC, MP4, ASF, AIFF, WAV, TrueAudio, WavPack, Ogg FLAC, Ogg
    Vorbis, Speex and Opus file formats.
  - Basic audio file properties such as length, sample rate, etc.
  - Long term binary and source compatibility.
  - Extensible design, notably the ability to add other formats or extend
  - current formats as a library user.
  - Full support for unicode and internationalized tags.
  - Dual MPL and LGPL licenses.
  - No external toolkit dependencies.
 .
 This package is the main metapackage for the TagLib Audio Meta-Data Library.
 Historically packages using TagLib should depend on this package rather than
 specific TagLib flavour even if the only vanilla (original) flavour is
 available at the moment.
